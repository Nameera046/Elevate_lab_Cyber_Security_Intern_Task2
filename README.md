# Elevate_lab_Cyber_Security_Intern_Task2

This task analyzes a sample phishing email impersonating services like PayPal. The email header showed spoofed sender details and authentication failures. Suspicious links redirected to mismatched domains when hovered. The message used urgent language such as “account suspension within 24 hours” and contained grammar errors. These indicators confirm typical phishing characteristics designed to trick users into revealing sensitive information.
